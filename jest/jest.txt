* Why Testing - when we update any changes in code, does it affect our application by using Automated Testing.

* Why Test? (advantages) = get an error if you break code, save time, Think about possible issues and bugs, integrate into build workflow, break up complex dependancies, improves code

*Test are of 3 types = 
1) Fully Isloated (testing 1 function),
2) Unit Tests (testing a function that calls a function),
3) E2E test(Full Flow or part application test, feature)

* we need test runner, assertions library, Headless browser to test code.
* Test runner - execute tests, summarize results. e.g. mocha
* assertions library - Defining test logic, expected outcome to compare with conditions. eg. chai
* Jest is great replacement for mocha and chai.
