* mobile is mini computer
* when we tap on screen, sensors in phone registers the tap and sends a message to OS
* now OS will look at data that it gets from the sensor.
* OS will now ask application, to work on given commands
* only 3 components for every single mobile app - screen, code, data
* phone has limited memory and have battery limitation, so we need to keep things in mind while working on app.
* while working on app, we have to work on edge cases like user switch to another app, user getting phone call.
