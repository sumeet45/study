Why we need data structure?
* we store data in any data structure, so we can retreive in future.
* to get data easily.
* choose data structure = data structure depend on which operations we are going to perform on that.
* purpose of data structure = to store and organize data in such way that, we can retreive data easily in future

* two types of DS - linear and non linear data structure
* linear DS - Arryay, linked list, and stack
* non linear DS - trees, graph, **hashing

Array - 
* showing how to calculate bytes for a[5] array - [1, 2,3, 4,......., 30]
