why sentence?
* will help to convey any form of idea.





Basic Concepts =
1) clause - 
* clause is a combination of words with a subject and verb.
ex - ram enjoyed

Types of clause -
* independant clause ( main clause )
* dependant clause  (subOrdinating clause)

	A) independant clause ( main clause )-
	* it makes complete sense and can stand alone.
	* clause = subject + verb;
	ex. ram shouted

	ex. laxman watched a movie.
		(sub)   (verb)   (obj)


	B) Dependant clause  ( SubOrdinate clause )-
	* something depend on something, like clause, statement or sentence.
	* depend on main clause for its meaning.


2) Coordinating Conjuction =
* helps to independent clauses to come together to form compound sentences.
* FANBOYS - for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so


3) Subordinating Conjuction =
* A WHITE BUS - Although, Whenever, However, If, Though, Even if, Because, Unless, Since






Types of Sentence =
1) Simple Sentence - contains only 1 clause and make complete sense independently.
	ex. 

2) Compound Sentence - need 2 indepedent clause (which makes sense independent) with Coordinating Conjuction 
	ex. ram sang and she danced.

3) Complex Sentence - need 1 independent and 1 dependent ( SubOrdinate ) clause with Subordinating Conjuction
	ex. She smiled because I cracked a Joke.
	ex. If she calls, let me know.

4) Compound Complex Sentence - 2 or more Independent clauses and 1 or more subordinate clauses With "Coordinating Conjuction" and "Subordinating Conjuction"
    ex. My son cried when i left the room, but i didn't hear.




Connectors and linking words = 
* 14 categories -
1) Explanation - tries to explain 
	a) Namely - while explaining, to add point ( I have a good reason not to talk to him. Namely, he is always rude to me. )
	b) In Other words - if first statement negative, add positive statement using with In other words ( Don't be rude when ypu are successful. In Other words, be down to earth )
	c) Put Differently - to explain it more ( we aren't talking to each other anymore. Put differently, we had break up ).

2) Emphasize - Put more emphasis on particular fact.
	a) as a matter of fact - ( He was quite late yesterday. As a matter of fact, I couldn't sleep until he arrived. )
	b) in fact - ( I didn't fail the exam; in fact I did rather well. )
	c) actually - ( you should gift her something expensive. Actually, a car won't be a bad idea. )
