why sentence?
* will help to convey any form of idea.





Basic Concepts =
1) clause - 
* clause is a combination of words with a subject and verb.
ex - ram enjoyed

	A) Types of clause -
	* independant clause ( main clause )
	* dependant clause  (subOrdinating clause)
	
		A) independant clause ( main clause )-
		* it makes complete sense and can stand alone.
		* clause = subject + verb;
		ex. ram shouted
	
		ex. laxman watched a movie.
			(sub)   (verb)   (obj)
	
	
		B) Dependant clause  ( SubOrdinate clause )-
		* something depend on something, like clause, statement or sentence.
		* depend on main clause for its meaning.
		* ex. I went out on the bike that Mary gave me for my birthday.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Coordinating Conjuction =
* helps to independent clauses to come together to form compound sentences.
* FANBOYS - for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so
* Use punctuation, before coordinating conjuction
* It was raining, so I carried an umbrella

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Subordinating Conjuction =
* A WHITE BUS - Although, Whenever, However, If, Though, Even if, Because, Unless, Since

------------------------------------------------------------------------




4) Types of Sentence =
1) Simple Sentence - contains only 1 clause and make complete sense independently. It has a subject and a verb or contains one clause.
	ex. Ram is a good boy
	In above one, "ram" is subject and 'is' is helping verb, which create 1 clause. 'a good boy' is object in sentence.

	other ex. Tiger ran

2) Compound Sentence - need 2 indepedent clause (which makes sense independent) with Coordinating Conjuction 
	ex. ram sang and she danced.

3) Complex Sentence - need 1 independent and 1 dependent ( SubOrdinate ) clause with Subordinating Conjuction
	ex. She smiled because I cracked a Joke.
	ex. If she calls, let me know.

4) Compound Complex Sentence - 2 or more Independent clauses and 1 or more subordinate clauses With "Coordinating Conjuction" and "Subordinating Conjuction"
* connected with conjuctions
    ex. My son cried when i left the room, but i didn't hear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Connectors and linking words = 
* 14 categories -
1) Explanation - tries to explain 
	a) Namely - while explaining, to add point ( I have a good reason not to talk to him. Namely, he is always rude to me. )
	b) In Other words - if first statement negative, add positive statement using with In other words ( Don't be rude when ypu are successful. In Other words, be down to earth )
	c) Put Differently - to explain it more ( we aren't talking to each other anymore. Put differently, we had break up ).

2) Emphasize - Put more emphasis on particular fact.
	a) as a matter of fact - ( He was quite late yesterday. As a matter of fact, I couldn't sleep until he arrived. )
	b) in fact - ( I didn't fail the exam; in fact I did rather well. )
	c) actually - ( you should gift her something expensive. Actually, a car won't be a bad idea. )
	d) indeed - I was annoyed, indeed furious, over what happened.

2) 
maximum of my friends done English speaking classes. I asked everyone can they speak English with confidence, but none of them is able to say yes, only one of them said yes I can speak confidently. I gave him simple topic Ganesh Festival. He speaks lot in English. Everyone of us surprised . We said how??? He is common guy who can hardly prepare to get passing marks in English subject, he is now speaking in front of us in English.

He told classes are okk but they teach only grammar n take little group discussions in classes but it doesn't work in my case. Only advantage I got from that is my basic grammar is ok now.

He told if you can manage to learn grammar at home then there is no need to join this type of classes and it is wasting of money.

I said if this is so then, what should we do to learn English and speak?

He told me,

Every new born baby don't go to learn their mother tongue at particular class, he start talking any word by hearing from peoples. He makes many mistake but we enjoy them talking like this. Then as he grow up he learn to speak and understand how to talk,etc. Likewise, we should start directly talking in English. If you have fear of peoples laugh then you can not speak English. At starting they laugh but then they claps for us. â˜º

He gave me some tips below give-

Read any English book or news paper try to understand it, if you can't understand then take dictionary with help of dictionary understand that lines.
Buy one register, while reading when you find any new word write down it in your register with pronunciation and its meaning in your mother tongue. Read those words daily once or twice.
If you bored reading text books then buy novel of love story. Those novels are very interesting. Chetan Bhagats novel are romantic. You can try different also.
Watch movies in English with subtitles.
Listen music in English.
Try to make conversation in English in your friend circle. Make that rule that nobody speak in other language.
If you want to talk with professional people then you can call any customer care it is free if cost for many companies. Talk them with their products, complaint them for their product, Give them suggestion if you want.
Write some lines daily in English.
make chats in English language.
And most important thing is when we speak English then we think in our mother tongue and then convert it in English. Start to think in English and then talk in English.
Follow this regularly until u can make conversations in English.

Good Luck
