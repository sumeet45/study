# 🧠 How to Use This

* Use this as a **phase-by-phase checklist**
* Do not move to the next phase without **key outputs**
* Keep **RAID, ADRs, and docs living**

If you want, I can:

* Turn this into a **1-page printable checklist**
* Create a **phase gate approval template**
* Convert this into an **Agile / DevOps version**

Just tell me what you need next 👍
