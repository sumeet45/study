When a file is shared through an API using JavaScript, the format largely depends on how the file is sent and how the API is designed to handle file uploads. The most common format used to send files is **multipart/form-data**. Here’s a breakdown of the formats and content types used:

### 1. **Multipart Form Data (Most Common Format)**
   - **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`
   - This format is used when uploading files through a form, often using the `FormData` object in JavaScript. Each part of the form (e.g., file, text field) is sent as a separate section of the request.
   - **How to use**: Files can be appended to a `FormData` object in JavaScript and sent using `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, or a library like Axios.
   
   ```javascript
   const formData = new FormData();
   formData.append('file', file);
   
   fetch('https://example.com/upload', {
     method: 'POST',
     body: formData
   });
   ```

   - This is useful for sending binary files (images, PDFs, videos, etc.) and form fields together.

### 2. **Base64 Encoding**
   - **Content-Type**: Depends on the file type, but often `application/json` when encoding as Base64 and sending within JSON.
   - Files can be converted to **Base64 strings** and sent as part of a JSON payload. This is common in APIs that require all data to be sent in a single JSON object.
   - **Example**: Convert the file to Base64 using JavaScript’s `FileReader` API.

   ```javascript
   const reader = new FileReader();
   reader.onload = function() {
     const base64String = reader.result.replace('data:', '').replace(/^.+,/, '');
     const payload = {
       file: base64String,
       fileName: file.name
     };
     fetch('https://example.com/upload', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       },
       body: JSON.stringify(payload)
     });
   };
   reader.readAsDataURL(file);
   ```

   - This approach is less efficient for larger files, as Base64 encoding increases the file size by about 33%.

### 3. **Binary (Raw Data)**
   - **Content-Type**: Depends on the file type (e.g., `application/pdf`, `image/png`, etc.)
   - You can upload a file as a binary stream directly by reading the file in raw form and sending it as the request body.
   
   ```javascript
   const file = document.querySelector('input[type="file"]').files[0];
   fetch('https://example.com/upload', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': file.type  // Use the file’s MIME type
     },
     body: file
   });
   ```

   - This method is suitable when you are dealing with an API that expects raw file data, such as when uploading large files like videos or archives.

### Summary of Content Types:
- **`multipart/form-data`**: Best for file uploads where you also need to send metadata or additional form fields. Common for most web applications.
- **`application/json` (with Base64 encoded data)**: Suitable for APIs that require files to be encoded into JSON format.
- **Specific MIME types (e.g., `image/jpeg`, `application/pdf`)**: Used when sending the raw binary data of the file directly.

### Use Case Example:
- If you’re uploading an image via an API, the API might require you to send it as `multipart/form-data` if it needs to handle additional fields like image titles or descriptions.
- In contrast, if the API accepts only JSON payloads, you would use **Base64 encoding** to include the image data in the JSON request.

The format you choose depends on the API requirements and the size/type of the file being uploaded.
