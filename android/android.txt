device type -> smartphone, tablet, wear, tv,
screen size -> small, normal, large, and extra large
screen density -> ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi

what is pixel?
 everything we see on screen is made up of these pixels.
 pixel denoted by "px", unit of pixel.
 single selection/dot is called picture element (PEL)
 picture element in short is called "pixel"
 one pixel is a one physical dot on the screen

screen resolution?
total number of pixel on the screen in horizontal and vertical
ex. 1080 x 1920 

Table
screen category     screen size            screen Resolution
small                 2 - 2.7              at least 426dp x 320dp
normal                2.7 - 4.3            at least 470dp x 320dp
large                 4 - 7                at least 640dp x 480dp
extra large           7 - 10               at least 960dp x 720dp


what is pixel density(dpi)?
pixel/dot > dpi/ppi (dot per inch/pixel per inch /pixel density per inch) 

how dpi effects User Interface?
1) more pixels in 1 inch > more dpi/ppi > clear image
2) less pixels in 1 inch > less dpi/ppi > blur image

pixel density buckets -
ldpi(120 dpi), mdpi(160 dpi), hdpi(240 dpi), xhdpi(320 dpi), xxhdpi(480 dpi), xxxhdpi(640 dpi)

* Always look for more ppi/dpi, not for higher resolution

What is device-independent-pixel(dp) & why we use it?
we want to design 1 layout and will give UI which works on all type of screen perfectly.

dp/ dip -
* Abbreviated "dp" or "dip", is a virtual pixel unit, equivalent to one physical pixel on mdpi screen & scaled proportionally on higher or lower density screens
* "dp"/"dip" is unit of "device-independent-pixels"
* like a pixel, "dp" is also unit of Screen measurement
* "dp" is logical measurement, not like pixel one.
* "dp" is independent of Screen density
* "1 dp" = different physcial pixels depending on the device screen
* used to define layout or views dimensions
* we specify dimensions in dp, eg height of button = 100dp
* at runtime, Android framework automatically converts the dp value into px value

dp to px conversion -
* 1dp = 1px on 160dpi(mdpi) screen (hence we call 160dpi is called baseline dpi)
* for other dpi screen, android converts dp into px using this formula,  px = dp*(screen dpi / 160)
* eg. app running on 200 dpi screen
    1px = 1dp * (screen dpi/160)
    1px = 1dp * (200/160)
    1px = 1.25dp

WsCube Tech - For Android development
1) Android Introduction -
* android is open source, linux-based operating system

What is OS?
* An OS is software programm that enables the hardware to communicate and operate with the software.
* OS is a interface between user and hardware

2) History Of android -
* in Oct 2003, 4 people created Android Inc.
* google acquired android inc. in 2005. In 2008, first android phone released.

3) Android versions A to Z -
* 

4) What is IDE for android -
* android studio for android development

8) What is Front end and Back end in Android app?
* Static and Dynamic app- 
  * Static application based on data which is available in apk. For dynamic app, it's mostly depend on server for its dynamic content.
*

7) Setting up our First project -
* adjust setting for android studio
* SDK - Software Development Kit, which is basically a set of softwares tools and libraries.

8) Day 1- Overview of the android studio interface
* giving little intro about Android studio, will tell in depth later videos.

9) Day 1 - understanding gradle -
* gradle fetches required things and helps to build application
* it's bit like package.json.

10) Day 1 - Changing the Scaling in android studio
* adjustin zoom level to see code properly

11) Setting up our Emulator -
* choose model from device manager (Pixel 7
* System image Optoin - choose android system image 
* AVD manager - adjust setting and create device
* run our app firs time with "Hello Android" text
* we have emulator setup and ran our first application in this video

12) Tip of the day -
* we can go through tips provided by android studio on opening editor.
* it will show various tips
