1) Background Stroy - 
  * started by James gosling in June 1991 and give name "Oak"
  * Java 1.0 in 1995
  * why Java - c-like notation, uniform and simple, general-purpose
  * Object-oriented
  * write once, run anywhere application - Java introduce JVM between OS and application. Application run on JVM, not directly on OS. so we can build Java Application platform independent.
  * Java is everywhere.
  * IDE


5) The language of 50 keywords -
  * Keyword is reserved word.
  * meaning of word, is known to compiler
  * keyword cannot be used as name of variable
  * Keywords are reserved words in Java that have specific meanings and cannot be used for any other purpose, such as variable names or method names. Java has a total of 50 keywords, which are used to define the syntax and structure of Java programming language. Hereâ€™s a list of Java keywords:

    abstract: used to declare a class or method as abstract. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, and an abstract method is a method without a body that must be implemented in a subclass.
    assert: used to perform assertion testing in Java. An assertion is a statement that should always be true, and if it is false, then an AssertionError is thrown.
    boolean: used to declare a boolean variable, which can only have two values: true or false.
    break: used to break out of a loop or switch statement.
    byte: used to declare a byte variable, which is a data type that can store values from -128 to 127.
    case: used in a switch statement to define a case label.
    catch: used to catch and handle exceptions in Java.
    char: used to declare a char variable, which is a data type that can store a single character.
    class: used to declare a class in Java.
    const: a keyword that was reserved but never implemented in Java.
    continue: used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue to the next iteration.
    default: used in a switch statement to define a default case.
    do: used to start a do-while loop.
    double: used to declare a double variable, which is a data type that can store decimal values.
    else: used in an if statement to define an alternative block of code to execute if the condition is false.
    enum: used to declare an enumeration, which is a type that consists of a set of named constants.
    extends: used to extend a class in Java.
    final: used to declare a variable or method as final, which means that its value or implementation cannot be changed.
    finally: used in a try-catch block to define a block of code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.
    float: used to declare a float variable, which is a data type that can store decimal values with less precision than double.
    for: used to start a for loop.
    goto: a keyword that was reserved but never implemented in Java.
    if: used to define a conditional statement in Java.
    implements: used to implement an interface in Java.
    import: used to import a package or class into a Java program.
    instanceof: used to check if an object is an instance of a particular class or interface.
    int: used to declare an int variable, which is a data type that can store whole numbers.
    interface: used to declare an interface in Java.
    long: used to declare a long variable, which is a data type that can store larger whole numbers than int.
    native: used to declare a method as native, which means that its implementation is provided by the underlying platform, rather than in Java code.
    new: used to create a new object in Java.
    package: used to define a package in Java.
    private: used to declare a variable or method as private, which means that it can only be accessed within the same class.
    protected: used to declare a variable or method as protected, which means that it can be accessed within the same class or any subclass.
    public: used to declare a variable or method as public, which means that it can be accessed from anywhere in the Java program.
    return: used to return a value from a method or exit a method without returning a value.
    short: used to declare a short variable, which is a data type that can store smaller whole numbers than int.
    static: used to declare a variable or method as static, which means that it belongs to the class rather than to individual objects of the class.
    strictfp: used to enforce strict floating-point precision in Java.
    super: used to call a method or constructor in the superclass.
    switch: used to start a switch statement in Java.
    synchronized: used to ensure that only one thread can access a block of code or object at a time in Java.
    this: used to refer to the current object in Java.
    throw: used to throw an exception in Java.
    throws: used to declare that a method may throw an exception in Java.
    transient: used to declare a variable as transient, which means that it will not be serialized when the object is written to a file or transmitted over a network.
    try: used to start a try-catch block in Java.
    void: used to declare a method that does not return a value.
    volatile: used to declare a variable as volatile, which means that it is subject to optimization by the Java Virtual Machine.

  * Rules to follow for keywords:
      * Keywords cannot be used as an identifier for class, subclass, variables, and methods.
      * Keywords are case-sensitive.

6) Our First Java Program -
* System.out.println()- to print on console.
* Here, "System" is class and "out" is subclass which consist println().

7) Variables and datatype -
  * variables - variable is space in memory. It helps to store data in memory. so we can process variable later.
  * data type - while declaring variable, we have to supply data type. Based on this, we will decide which type of data would come in variables
ex.  int num1 = 25;
     string str1 = "sumeet";

8) Understanding varibles -
  * when we declare variable without initialize and run application, it will crash bcz of variable without initialization like below -
    int value1;
    System.out.println(value1);

   Output - //ERROR!
  * int value1 = 4;
   System.out.println(value1);    // 4

  * int value1 = 1, value2 = 2;     // valid syntax
  * we can do basic operation and store value in variable too.
   int value3 = (2*2)-1;
  * variable names are case sensitive. 


9) Primitive Data types (Integer datatype) -
  * int - stands for integer ( for whole number ). 
    ex.   int max = 2147483647;  // int can contain number from "-2147483648" to "2147483647"

  * short max = 32767;    // for short, "-32768" to "32767"
  * long max = 9223372036854775807L;  //for long variable, "-9,223,372,036,854,775,808" to "9,223,372,036,854,775,807" and also need to add "L"
  * byte max = 127;   // for byte variable, "-128" to "127"


10) Primitive Data types (Floating point datatype) -
  * whenever we want to store decimal number, we have to use "float" and "double" data type.
  * could be 2 value - float (floating point) and double (floating point with double precision)
  * float occupy 32 bit of space in memory
  * double occupy 64 bit of space in memory
  * why double? - more precise, programm will run fast
  * int datatype preferred over long, byte, short
  * ex.  float value2 = 3f;
         double value3 = 9.903922dd;

  * ex.  float value2 = 10f/6f;     // 1.6666666
         double value3 = 10d/6d;    // 1.6666666666666667


11) BigDecimal Introduction -
  * BigDecimal helps to acheive ultra precision with decimal number
  * ex.  BigDecimal d1 = new BigDecimal("1.05");   // used number with double quoation, it helps to do addition properly
         BigDecimal d2 = new BigDecimal("1.05");
         System.out.println(d1.add(d2));    // 3.60
  * do research on BigDecimal

12) Primitive data type (Boolean and Char data type) -
  * boolean helps to store boolean values like true and false.
  * char helps to store single character in variable with single quoates. we can add unicode in single quoates and print any character.
        char var1 = 'b';
        boolean var2 = false;
        System.out.println(var1);   // b
        System.out.println(var2);   // false

13) String Basics -
  * String is sequence of characters.
    ex. String str = "Hello world";
