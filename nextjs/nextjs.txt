2) Introduction and Welcome
core features - Server Side Rendering, Static site generation, Effeicient routing to create web apps

3) Why choose Next.js?
* speed, scalability, and flexibility comes with next js
* SSR (Server Side Rendering)- Content is rendered on server and then sent to the user's browser. Faster load times. Better SEO. Overall improved performance.
* Static Site Generation - next js generate static HTML pages that load lkightining fast.
* Easy routing - by just adding folder, we can create route
* Automatic Code Splitting - Splits your code into smaller bundles, only the necessary JS loads for each page
* Great For SEO - Because of Server side rendering search engines can crawl your pages easily.
* Built in API routes - Create API routes directly in project

4) Installing next.js and Initial Setup - 
* first install nodejs
* then use -  "npx create-next-app@latest"
* also check version - "npx next -v"
* visit folder and run App - "cd my-app" and "npm run dev"
* site available on "http://localhost:3000"

5) First look at a Next.js Page -
* to create new page in next js, you need to create folder beside to "page.tsx". suppose, we want to create route "about". For that, we have to create folder "about" near to "page.tsx" in app folder. within that, add "page.tsx", so it will server for "localhost:3000/about"
* NextJs automatically generate route for us.
* add code in main "page.tsx" -       <Link href="/about" >Got to about page</Link> to redirect user to "about" page.
* to transit from one page to another, it uses "Client Side Navigation". it only update parts of page only. hence it becomes so fast.

6) Getting Started with next.js -
* Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. it means server app??-
  Next.js being a full-stack React framework means it provides the tools and capabilities to handle both the frontend (client-side) and the backend (server-side) aspects of a web application within a single framework. 
  It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly.
  Next.js has two different routers:
    a) App Router: The newer router that supports new React features like Server Components.
    b) Pages Router: The original router, still supported and being improved.


8) Pages and Routing in next.js - 
* let's try to create dynamic pages, based on data with next js
* For this, we will add folder - "posts/[id]". within that, add page.tsx. 
* Add following code -
  export default async function Post({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
    const { id } = await params; // <-- FIX
      return (
      <main>
        <h1>Post Page</h1>
        <p>Post ID:111 - {id}</p>
      </main>
    );
  }

9) Fetching Data in next.js -
* code -
  import { posts } from '../../data/posts';
  export default async function Post({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
      const { id } = await params; // <-- FIX
      const post = posts.find((post) => post.id === id);
      if(!post){
          return (
              <main>
                  <h1>Post Not Found</h1>
                  <p>No post found with ID: {id}</p>
              </main>
          );
      }
      return (
      <main>
        <h1>Post Page</h1>
        <p>Post ID: - {id}</p>
        <p>{post?.title}</p>
        <p>{post?.content}</p>
      </main>
    );
  }

10) Styling components in Next.js -
* External CSS file - created and applied to Post Component
* Create "post.module.css" and importing in "post.tsx"
* by "tailwind", we can manage css. using tailwind classes, we can styled our UI.
* CSS modules offers custom styling, while tailwind offers utility first approach for quick layouts


11) Routing in Next.js – How to Use App Router in your Next Apps -
* https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/routing-in-nextjs/
  * The Pages Directory and App Router are two crucial components that determine how users navigate through a Next.js application.
  * In Pages router, we create folder like following - "pages/about/index.ts"
  * In App router, folder - "app/about/pages.tsx"
  * Apart from routing, App Router boasts a range of other features, including: 1) Layout Component, 2) Nested Layouts, 3) Template Components, 4) Loading Component, 5) Streaming, 6) Error Component, 7) Server Components

12) Adding Navigations with next.js -
* To maintain same structure across app, we use Layout Component. 
* home.tsx -
   <Layout>
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
      <Link href="/about" >Got to about page</Link><br />
  </Layout>

13) Using Environment Variables in Next.js
* to add env config, we need to add it to root directory
