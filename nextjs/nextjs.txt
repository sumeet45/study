"Introduction to Next.js"

2) Introduction and Welcome
core features - Server Side Rendering, Static site generation, Effeicient routing to create web apps

3) Why choose Next.js?
* speed, scalability, and flexibility comes with next js
* SSR (Server Side Rendering)- Content is rendered on server and then sent to the user's browser. Faster load times. Better SEO. Overall improved performance.
* Static Site Generation - next js generate static HTML pages that load lkightining fast.
* Easy routing - by just adding folder, we can create route
* Automatic Code Splitting - Splits your code into smaller bundles, only the necessary JS loads for each page
* Great For SEO - Because of Server side rendering search engines can crawl your pages easily.
* Built in API routes - Create API routes directly in project

4) Installing next.js and Initial Setup - 
* first install nodejs
* then use -  "npx create-next-app@latest"
* also check version - "npx next -v"
* visit folder and run App - "cd my-app" and "npm run dev"
* site available on "http://localhost:3000"

5) First look at a Next.js Page -
* to create new page in next js, you need to create folder beside to "page.tsx". suppose, we want to create route "about". For that, we have to create folder "about" near to "page.tsx" in app folder. within that, add "page.tsx", so it will server for "localhost:3000/about"
* NextJs automatically generate route for us.
* add code in main "page.tsx" -       <Link href="/about" >Got to about page</Link> to redirect user to "about" page.
* to transit from one page to another, it uses "Client Side Navigation". it only update parts of page only. hence it becomes so fast.

6) Getting Started with next.js -
* Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. it means server app??-
  Next.js being a full-stack React framework means it provides the tools and capabilities to handle both the frontend (client-side) and the backend (server-side) aspects of a web application within a single framework. 
  It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly.
  Next.js has two different routers:
    a) App Router: The newer router that supports new React features like Server Components.
    b) Pages Router: The original router, still supported and being improved.


8) Pages and Routing in next.js - 
* let's try to create dynamic pages, based on data with next js
* For this, we will add folder - "posts/[id]". within that, add page.tsx. 
* Add following code -
  export default async function Post({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
    const { id } = await params; // <-- FIX
      return (
      <main>
        <h1>Post Page</h1>
        <p>Post ID:111 - {id}</p>
      </main>
    );
  }

9) Fetching Data in next.js -
* code -
  import { posts } from '../../data/posts';
  export default async function Post({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
      const { id } = await params; // <-- FIX
      const post = posts.find((post) => post.id === id);
      if(!post){
          return (
              <main>
                  <h1>Post Not Found</h1>
                  <p>No post found with ID: {id}</p>
              </main>
          );
      }
      return (
      <main>
        <h1>Post Page</h1>
        <p>Post ID: - {id}</p>
        <p>{post?.title}</p>
        <p>{post?.content}</p>
      </main>
    );
  }

10) Styling components in Next.js -
* External CSS file - created and applied to Post Component
* Create "post.module.css" and importing in "post.tsx"
* by "tailwind", we can manage css. using tailwind classes, we can styled our UI.
* CSS modules offers custom styling, while tailwind offers utility first approach for quick layouts


11) Routing in Next.js – How to Use App Router in your Next Apps -
* https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/routing-in-nextjs/
  * The Pages Directory and App Router are two crucial components that determine how users navigate through a Next.js application.
  * In Pages router, we create folder like following - "pages/about/index.ts"
  * In App router, folder - "app/about/pages.tsx"
  * Apart from routing, App Router boasts a range of other features, including: 1) Layout Component, 2) Nested Layouts, 3) Template Components, 4) Loading Component, 5) Streaming, 6) Error Component, 7) Server Components

12) Adding Navigations with next.js -
* To maintain same structure across app, we use Layout Component. 
* home.tsx -
   <Layout>
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
      <Link href="/about" >Got to about page</Link><br />
  </Layout>

13) Using Environment Variables in Next.js
* to add env config, we need to add it to root directory

  Routing Files -
  Add page to expose a route, layout for shared UI such as header, nav, or footer, loading for skeletons, error for error boundaries, and route for APIs.
    layout -	.js .jsx .tsx	Layout
    page - 	.js .jsx .tsx	Page
    loading -	 .js .jsx .tsx	Loading UI
    not-found - 	.js .jsx .tsx	Not found UI
    error  -	.js .jsx .tsx	Error UI
    global-error  -	.js .jsx .tsx	Global error UI
    route  -	.js .ts	API endpoint
    template  -	.js .jsx .tsx	Re-rendered layout
    default  -	.js .jsx .tsx	Parallel route fallback page


  * Nested routes
    Folders define URL segments. Nesting folders nests segments. Layouts at any level wrap their child segments. A route becomes public when a page or route file exists.
  
  Path	                        URL               pattern	Notes
  app/layout.tsx	              —	                Root layout wraps all routes
  app/blog/layout.tsx	          —	                Wraps /blog and descendants
  app/page.tsx	                /	                Public route
  app/blog/page.tsx	            /blog	            Public route
  app/blog/authors/page.tsx	    /blog/authors	    Public route


  * Dynamic routes -
    Parameterize segments with square brackets. Use [segment] for a single param, [...segment] for catch‑all, and [[...segment]] for optional catch‑all. Access values via the params prop.
  
  Path	                                URL pattern
  app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx	            /blog/my-first-post
  app/shop/[...slug]/page.tsx	          /shop/clothing, /shop/clothing/shirts
  app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx	        /docs, /docs/layouts-and-pages, /docs/api-reference/use-router


  * Route groups and private folders -
    Organize code without changing URLs with route groups (group), and colocate non-routable files with private folders _folder.
    * Route groups let you organize your app structure without affecting the URL path.
    * A folder starting with underscore _ is private. Any folder starting with _ is ignored by routing.  Next.js does not create a route for it
  
  Path	                                  URL       pattern	Notes
  app/(marketing)/page.tsx	              /	        Group omitted from URL
  app/(shop)/cart/page.tsx	              /cart	    Share layouts within (shop)
  app/blog/_components/Post.tsx	          —	        Not routable; safe place for UI utilities
  app/blog/_lib/data.ts	                  —	        Not routable; safe place for utils


  * Parallel and Intercepted Routes
    * These features fit specific UI patterns, such as slot-based layouts or modal routing.
    * Use @slot for named slots rendered by a parent layout. Use intercept patterns to render another route inside the current layout without changing the URL, for example, to show a details view as a modal over a list.
    
    Pattern (docs)	                  Meaning	                  Typical use case
    @folder	                          Named slot	              Sidebar + main content
    (.)folder	                        Intercept same level	    Preview sibling route in a modal
    (..)folder	                      Intercept parent	        Open a child of the parent as an overlay
    (..)(..)folder	                  Intercept two levels	    Deeply nested overlay
    (...)folder	                      Intercept from root	      Show arbitrary route in current view


  * Metadata file conventions
    App icons
    favicon	      .ico	Favicon file
