1) Simple Factory Pattern - 

Here is the **clearest explanation of the Simple Factory Pattern** in **JavaScript**, using the same Logistics example (**Truck** and **Ship**).

---

# 🚀 **Simple Factory Pattern (Also called Static Factory)**

⚡ It is *not* a GOF design pattern, but widely used.
⚡ It is the simplest way to centralize object creation.
⚡ Uses **one factory class** with **one method** that returns different objects.

---

# 🟥 Before Simple Factory (Bad Approach)

You directly create objects everywhere using `new`.

```js
const t1 = new Truck();
const t2 = new Ship();
```

### ❌ Problems:

* Repeated code
* If you add `Plane`, you must update everywhere
* Many `new` scattered → hard to maintain

---

# 🟩 Simple Factory Pattern (Good Approach)

A factory method called `createTransport(type)` decides which object to return.

---

# 🟦 **1️⃣ Product Classes**

```js
class Truck {
  deliver() {
    console.log("Delivering cargo by road...");
  }
}

class Ship {
  deliver() {
    console.log("Delivering cargo by sea...");
  }
}
```

---

# 🟦 **2️⃣ Simple Factory**

```js
class TransportFactory {
  static createTransport(type) {
    if (type === "truck") return new Truck();
    if (type === "ship") return new Ship();

    throw new Error("Unknown transport type");
  }
}
```

### ✔ Centralized creation

### ✔ Only one place to maintain

### ✔ Uses `if/else` **inside factory**, not everywhere

---

# 🟦 **3️⃣ Usage**

```js
const t1 = TransportFactory.createTransport("truck");
t1.deliver();
// → Delivering cargo by road...

const t2 = TransportFactory.createTransport("ship");
t2.deliver();
// → Delivering cargo by sea...
```

---

# 🟩 Where Simple Factory is Useful

✔ When you have only **1 factory**
✔ When object creation is simple
✔ When you want to remove scattered `new` keywords
✔ When new product types are rare
✔ Good for small to medium apps

---

# 🟥 Limitations of Simple Factory

Although better than hardcoding:

### ❌ Violates Open–Closed Principle (OCP)

To add a new type:

```js
if (type === "plane") return new Plane();
```

You must modify the factory.

### ❌ Still relies on `if/else`

Better than spreading them everywhere, but still not perfect.

### ❌ Cannot be extended through subclassing

Unlike Factory Method.

# 🟩 Simple Factory vs Factory Method vs Abstract Factory

| Pattern              | Why Used?                        | Pros                  | Cons         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| **Simple Factory**   | Centralize object creation       | Easy, single place    | Breaks OCP   |
| **Factory Method**   | Subclass decides product         | Extensible            | More classes |
| **Abstract Factory** | Create multiple related products | Clean family creation | Most complex |

---

# 🎯 One-Line Summary

**Simple Factory → One class decides which product to create based on a parameter.**

---



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just remember (Super class, sub class, and product)

2) Factory Method Pattern -

Great — here is the **BEST AND SIMPLEST Logistics example** of **Factory Method** using **Truck** and **Ship** as products.
I’ll show you:

1️⃣ BEFORE Factory Method (bad way)
2️⃣ AFTER Factory Method (correct way)
3️⃣ Clear explanation

---

# 🚫 **BEFORE Factory Method**

(You manually create Truck/Ship using if-else)

You have a Logistics system that delivers cargo using **Truck** or **Ship**.

## ❌ The Problem

* Logic is coupled with `Truck` and `Ship`
* Adding `Airplane` means modifying multiple places
* Violates Open–Closed Principle

---

## ❌ **Before Example Code**

```js
class Logistics {
  deliver(type) {
    let transport;

    if (type === "truck") {
      transport = new Truck();
    } else if (type === "ship") {
      transport = new Ship();
    }

    transport.start();
    transport.deliverCargo();
  }
}

class Truck {
  start() {
    console.log("Truck starting to drive...");
  }
  deliverCargo() {
    console.log("Delivering cargo by road");
  }
}

class Ship {
  start() {
    console.log("Ship starting to sail...");
  }
  deliverCargo() {
    console.log("Delivering cargo by sea");
  }
}

const logistics = new Logistics();
logistics.deliver("truck");
```

---

## ❌ **Issues**

* Adding `Plane` → must add new `if`
* Code becomes long and messy
* Parent class knows too much about object creation
* Hard to maintain

---

# ✅ **AFTER Factory Method**

Parent class defines the **process**.
Child class decides **which transport object** to create.

---

# 🟩 **1️⃣ Product Classes (Truck, Ship)**

```js
class Truck {
  start() {
    console.log("Truck driving on the road...");
  }
  deliverCargo() {
    console.log("Cargo delivered by Truck.");
  }
}

class Ship {
  start() {
    console.log("Ship sailing on the sea...");
  }
  deliverCargo() {
    console.log("Cargo delivered by Ship.");
  }
}
```

---

# 🟩 **2️⃣ Superclass Defines the Factory Method**

```js
class Logistics {
  // Factory Method
  createTransport() {
    throw new Error("Subclass must implement createTransport()");
  }

  // Business logic (same for all transports)
  planDelivery() {
    const transport = this.createTransport();
    transport.start();
    transport.deliverCargo();
  }
}
```

✔ Parent knows **HOW to deliver**,
❌ but does **NOT** know **WHICH** transport.

---

# 🟩 **3️⃣ Subclasses Decide the Transport Type**

```js
class RoadLogistics extends Logistics {
  createTransport() {
    return new Truck();
  }
}

class SeaLogistics extends Logistics {
  createTransport() {
    return new Ship();
  }
}
```

✔ Each subclass provides the correct transport
✔ No need for `if / else`

---

# 🟩 **4️⃣ Usage**

```js
const road = new RoadLogistics();
road.planDelivery();
// → Truck driving on the road...
// → Cargo delivered by Truck.

const sea = new SeaLogistics();
sea.planDelivery();
// → Ship sailing on the sea...
// → Cargo delivered by Ship.
```

# 🟥 BEFORE vs AFTER (Quick Comparison)

| Feature                      | BEFORE                 | AFTER (Factory Method)  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Uses `new Truck()` in parent | ❌ Yes                  | ✔ No                    |
| Uses `if / else`             | ❌ Yes                  | ✔ No                    |
| Add new product (Airplane)   | ❌ Modify existing code | ✔ Add new subclass only |
| Follows Open–Closed?         | ❌ No                   | ✔ Yes                   |
| Who decides object creation? | Parent                 | Child subclass          |

---

# 🎯 **One Line Summary**

**Factory Method moves object creation logic from the parent to its subclasses.**

If you want, I can also provide:

✅ Diagram for this logistics example
✅ Abstract Factory version (LandFactory, SeaFactory)
✅ Real-life logistics analogy
Just tell me!


✔ Use Factory Method When:
* You want subclasses to decide what object gets created
* You want your design to follow Open–Closed Principle
* You will add new object types often
* You want to avoid large if/else or switch statements
* Object creation logic may become complex or change dynamically
* You need polymorphic creation based on context
