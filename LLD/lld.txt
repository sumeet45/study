1) Simple Factory Pattern - 

Here is the **clearest explanation of the Simple Factory Pattern** in **JavaScript**, using the same Logistics example (**Truck** and **Ship**).

---

# 🚀 **Simple Factory Pattern (Also called Static Factory)**

⚡ It is *not* a GOF design pattern, but widely used.
⚡ It is the simplest way to centralize object creation.
⚡ Uses **one factory class** with **one method** that returns different objects.

---

# 🟥 Before Simple Factory (Bad Approach)

You directly create objects everywhere using `new`.

```js
const t1 = new Truck();
const t2 = new Ship();
```

### ❌ Problems:

* Repeated code
* If you add `Plane`, you must update everywhere
* Many `new` scattered → hard to maintain

---

# 🟩 Simple Factory Pattern (Good Approach)

A factory method called `createTransport(type)` decides which object to return.

---

# 🟦 **1️⃣ Product Classes**

```js
class Truck {
  deliver() {
    console.log("Delivering cargo by road...");
  }
}

class Ship {
  deliver() {
    console.log("Delivering cargo by sea...");
  }
}
```

---

# 🟦 **2️⃣ Simple Factory**

```js
class TransportFactory {
  static createTransport(type) {
    if (type === "truck") return new Truck();
    if (type === "ship") return new Ship();

    throw new Error("Unknown transport type");
  }
}
```

### ✔ Centralized creation

### ✔ Only one place to maintain

### ✔ Uses `if/else` **inside factory**, not everywhere

---

# 🟦 **3️⃣ Usage**

```js
const t1 = TransportFactory.createTransport("truck");
t1.deliver();
// → Delivering cargo by road...

const t2 = TransportFactory.createTransport("ship");
t2.deliver();
// → Delivering cargo by sea...
```

---

# 🟩 Where Simple Factory is Useful

✔ When you have only **1 factory**
✔ When object creation is simple
✔ When you want to remove scattered `new` keywords
✔ When new product types are rare
✔ Good for small to medium apps

---

# 🟥 Limitations of Simple Factory

Although better than hardcoding:

### ❌ Violates Open–Closed Principle (OCP)

To add a new type:

```js
if (type === "plane") return new Plane();
```

You must modify the factory.

### ❌ Still relies on `if/else`

Better than spreading them everywhere, but still not perfect.

### ❌ Cannot be extended through subclassing

Unlike Factory Method.

# 🟩 Simple Factory vs Factory Method vs Abstract Factory

| Pattern              | Why Used?                        | Pros                  | Cons         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| **Simple Factory**   | Centralize object creation       | Easy, single place    | Breaks OCP   |
| **Factory Method**   | Subclass decides product         | Extensible            | More classes |
| **Abstract Factory** | Create multiple related products | Clean family creation | Most complex |

---

# 🎯 One-Line Summary

**Simple Factory → One class decides which product to create based on a parameter.**

---



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just remember (Super class, sub classes, and products)

2) Factory Method Pattern -

Great — here is the **BEST AND SIMPLEST Logistics example** of **Factory Method** using **Truck** and **Ship** as products.
I’ll show you:

1️⃣ BEFORE Factory Method (bad way)
2️⃣ AFTER Factory Method (correct way)
3️⃣ Clear explanation

---

# 🚫 **BEFORE Factory Method**

(You manually create Truck/Ship using if-else)

You have a Logistics system that delivers cargo using **Truck** or **Ship**.

## ❌ The Problem

* Logic is coupled with `Truck` and `Ship`
* Adding `Airplane` means modifying multiple places
* Violates Open–Closed Principle

---

## ❌ **Before Example Code**

```js
class Logistics {
  deliver(type) {
    let transport;

    if (type === "truck") {
      transport = new Truck();
    } else if (type === "ship") {
      transport = new Ship();
    }

    transport.start();
    transport.deliverCargo();
  }
}

class Truck {
  start() {
    console.log("Truck starting to drive...");
  }
  deliverCargo() {
    console.log("Delivering cargo by road");
  }
}

class Ship {
  start() {
    console.log("Ship starting to sail...");
  }
  deliverCargo() {
    console.log("Delivering cargo by sea");
  }
}

const logistics = new Logistics();
logistics.deliver("truck");
```

---

## ❌ **Issues**

* Adding `Plane` → must add new `if`
* Code becomes long and messy
* Parent class knows too much about object creation
* Hard to maintain

---

# ✅ **AFTER Factory Method**

Parent class defines the **process**.
Child class decides **which transport object** to create.

---

# 🟩 **1️⃣ Product Classes (Truck, Ship)**

```js
class Truck {
  start() {
    console.log("Truck driving on the road...");
  }
  deliverCargo() {
    console.log("Cargo delivered by Truck.");
  }
}

class Ship {
  start() {
    console.log("Ship sailing on the sea...");
  }
  deliverCargo() {
    console.log("Cargo delivered by Ship.");
  }
}
```

---

# 🟩 **2️⃣ Superclass Defines the Factory Method**

```js
class Logistics {
  // Factory Method
  createTransport() {
    throw new Error("Subclass must implement createTransport()");
  }

  // Business logic (same for all transports)
  planDelivery() {
    const transport = this.createTransport();
    transport.start();
    transport.deliverCargo();
  }
}
```

✔ Parent knows **HOW to deliver**,
❌ but does **NOT** know **WHICH** transport.

---

# 🟩 **3️⃣ Subclasses Decide the Transport Type**

```js
class RoadLogistics extends Logistics {
  createTransport() {
    return new Truck();
  }
}

class SeaLogistics extends Logistics {
  createTransport() {
    return new Ship();
  }
}
```

✔ Each subclass provides the correct transport
✔ No need for `if / else`

---

# 🟩 **4️⃣ Usage**

```js
const road = new RoadLogistics();
road.planDelivery();
// → Truck driving on the road...
// → Cargo delivered by Truck.

const sea = new SeaLogistics();
sea.planDelivery();
// → Ship sailing on the sea...
// → Cargo delivered by Ship.
```

---

# 🟥 BEFORE vs AFTER (Quick Comparison)

| Feature                      | BEFORE                 | AFTER (Factory Method)  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Uses `new Truck()` in parent | ❌ Yes                  | ✔ No                    |
| Uses `if / else`             | ❌ Yes                  | ✔ No                    |
| Add new product (Airplane)   | ❌ Modify existing code | ✔ Add new subclass only |
| Follows Open–Closed?         | ❌ No                   | ✔ Yes                   |
| Who decides object creation? | Parent                 | Child subclass          |

---

# 🎯 **One Line Summary**

**Factory Method moves object creation logic from the parent to its subclasses.**

---

If you want, I can also provide:

✅ Diagram for this logistics example
✅ Abstract Factory version (LandFactory, SeaFactory)
✅ Real-life logistics analogy
Just tell me!


✔ Use Factory Method When:
* You want subclasses to decide what object gets created
* You want your design to follow Open–Closed Principle
* You will add new object types often
* You want to avoid large if/else or switch statements
* Object creation logic may become complex or change dynamically
* You need polymorphic creation based on context


Real-World Examples -
Payment Gateways: An e-commerce platform uses a factory to return specific payment processors (Stripe, PayPal, or Credit Card) based on user selection without changing the core checkout logic.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just remember ( multiple products in abstract, 1 product in factory )



3) Abstract Factory Pattern -

Below is a **deep, structured explanation of the Abstract Factory Pattern**, tied to what you already know about **Simple Factory** and **Factory Method**, and using **clear JavaScript examples**.

---

# 🏭 Abstract Factory Pattern — In Depth

## 1️⃣ What Is Abstract Factory? (Core Idea)

> **Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating *families of related objects* without specifying their concrete classes.**

### In simple words:

* You don’t create **one object**
* You create **a set (family) of objects** that are designed to work together
* You switch the **entire family** by switching the factory

---

## 2️⃣ Why Do We Need Abstract Factory?

Factory Method creates **one product**.

But in real systems, objects come in **groups**:

### Logistics Example

When you choose a logistics mode, you don’t just choose:

* 🚚 Truck
  You also need:
* 👨‍✈️ Driver
* 📄 Route Planner
* 🧾 Insurance Policy

These must be **compatible** with each other.

Abstract Factory ensures:

* Road logistics objects work together
* Sea logistics objects work together
* No mixing (Truck + Ship Captain ❌)

---

## 3️⃣ Structure of Abstract Factory

### Participants

| Role                | Description                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **AbstractFactory** | Declares methods for creating each product |
| **ConcreteFactory** | Implements methods for a specific family   |
| **AbstractProduct** | Interface/base class for products          |
| **ConcreteProduct** | Actual implementations                     |
| **Client**          | Uses only abstract interfaces              |

---

## 4️⃣ Logistics Example (Truck / Ship family)

### Families:

* **Road family** → Truck + RoadDriver
* **Sea family** → Ship + SeaCaptain

---

## 5️⃣ Step-by-Step JavaScript Implementation

---

### 🟦 1. Abstract Products

```js
class Transport {
  deliver() {
    throw new Error("deliver() must be implemented");
  }
}

class Driver {
  drive() {
    throw new Error("drive() must be implemented");
  }
}
```

---

### 🟦 2. Concrete Products

```js
// Road products
class Truck extends Transport {
  deliver() {
    console.log("Delivering cargo by road");
  }
}

class RoadDriver extends Driver {
  drive() {
    console.log("Driving a truck");
  }
}

// Sea products
class Ship extends Transport {
  deliver() {
    console.log("Delivering cargo by sea");
  }
}

class SeaCaptain extends Driver {
  drive() {
    console.log("Sailing a ship");
  }
}
```

---

### 🟦 3. Abstract Factory

```js
class LogisticsFactory {
  createTransport() {
    throw new Error("createTransport() must be implemented");
  }

  createDriver() {
    throw new Error("createDriver() must be implemented");
  }
}
```

☝️ This factory defines **what products exist in a family**.

---

### 🟦 4. Concrete Factories

```js
class RoadLogisticsFactory extends LogisticsFactory {
  createTransport() {
    return new Truck();
  }

  createDriver() {
    return new RoadDriver();
  }
}

class SeaLogisticsFactory extends LogisticsFactory {
  createTransport() {
    return new Ship();
  }

  createDriver() {
    return new SeaCaptain();
  }
}
```

Each factory guarantees **compatible objects**.

---

### 🟦 5. Client Code (Important Part)

```js
function startDelivery(factory) {
  const transport = factory.createTransport();
  const driver = factory.createDriver();

  driver.drive();
  transport.deliver();
}
```

☝️ Client does NOT know:

* Truck or Ship
* Road or Sea
* Concrete class names

---

### 🟦 6. Usage

```js
const roadFactory = new RoadLogisticsFactory();
startDelivery(roadFactory);

const seaFactory = new SeaLogisticsFactory();
startDelivery(seaFactory);
```

### Output

```
Driving a truck
Delivering cargo by road

Sailing a ship
Delivering cargo by sea
```

---

## 6️⃣ Key Benefits (Why It Exists)

### ✅ Ensures compatibility

* No mixing families accidentally

### ✅ Single switch point

* Change entire system by switching factory

### ✅ Strong decoupling

* Client depends on abstractions only

### ✅ Open–Closed Principle

* Add new family → new factory
* No client code change

---

## 7️⃣ Comparison with Factory Method

| Aspect           | Factory Method | Abstract Factory   |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Creates          | One product    | Family of products |
| Uses inheritance | Yes            | Yes                |
| Switch behavior  | Subclass       | Factory object     |
| Example          | Truck OR Ship  | Truck + Driver     |
| Complexity       | Medium         | Higher             |

---

## 8️⃣ Common Real-World Uses

| Domain              | Abstract Factory Usage               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| UI Frameworks       | LightThemeFactory / DarkThemeFactory |
| Cross-platform apps | WindowsFactory / MacFactory          |
| Databases           | MySQLFactory / MongoFactory          |
| Cloud SDKs          | AWSFactory / AzureFactory            |
| Testing             | RealFactory / MockFactory            |

---

## 9️⃣ When NOT to Use Abstract Factory

❌ If you only need one object
❌ If product families are unlikely to grow
❌ If complexity outweighs benefits

Use **Factory Method** instead.

---

## 🔑 Final Mental Model

> **Factory Method**
> → Chooses *how to create one object*

> **Abstract Factory**
> → Chooses *which family of objects to use*

---

## 🧠 One-Line Summary

**Abstract Factory lets you swap entire product families without changing client code.**

4) Builder Pattern -
Below is an **in-depth, end-to-end explanation of the Builder Pattern**, with **concepts, structure, variations, pros/cons, and real-world + JavaScript examples**—the level expected in **system design / solution architect interviews**.

---

# 🧱 Builder Pattern (Creational Design Pattern)

## 1️⃣ What is the Builder Pattern?

**Definition (GoF)**

> Builder Pattern separates the **construction of a complex object** from its **representation**, so the same construction process can create different representations.

In simple terms:

* You **build an object step by step**
* Construction logic is **decoupled** from the final object
* Especially useful when an object has **many optional parameters**

---

## 2️⃣ Problem It Solves (Why Builder?)

### ❌ Problem: Telescoping Constructors

```js
class House {
  constructor(
    walls,
    doors,
    windows,
    hasGarage,
    hasSwimmingPool,
    hasGarden
  ) {
    this.walls = walls;
    this.doors = doors;
    this.windows = windows;
    this.hasGarage = hasGarage;
    this.hasSwimmingPool = hasSwimmingPool;
    this.hasGarden = hasGarden;
  }
}
```

Usage becomes ugly:

```js
new House(4, 2, 6, true, false, true);
```

❗ Problems:

* Hard to read
* Easy to make mistakes
* Constructor explodes as options grow

---

## 3️⃣ Builder Pattern – Core Idea

Instead of passing everything at once:

* Use a **Builder** to configure step by step
* Call `.build()` at the end

```js
new HouseBuilder()
  .setWalls(4)
  .setDoors(2)
  .setWindows(6)
  .setGarage(true)
  .build();
```

✔ Readable
✔ Flexible
✔ Safe

---

## 4️⃣ Structure (UML-level Understanding)

### Participants

| Component               | Responsibility              |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Product**             | Final complex object        |
| **Builder (interface)** | Declares building steps     |
| **ConcreteBuilder**     | Implements steps            |
| **Director (optional)** | Orchestrates building order |

---

## 5️⃣ Simple Builder (Fluent Builder – Most Common in JS)

### Product

```js
class House {
  constructor(builder) {
    this.walls = builder.walls;
    this.doors = builder.doors;
    this.windows = builder.windows;
    this.garage = builder.garage;
    this.pool = builder.pool;
  }
}
```

### Builder

```js
class HouseBuilder {
  setWalls(walls) {
    this.walls = walls;
    return this;
  }

  setDoors(doors) {
    this.doors = doors;
    return this;
  }

  setWindows(windows) {
    this.windows = windows;
    return this;
  }

  setGarage(hasGarage) {
    this.garage = hasGarage;
    return this;
  }

  setPool(hasPool) {
    this.pool = hasPool;
    return this;
  }

  build() {
    return new House(this);
  }
}
```

### Usage

```js
const house = new HouseBuilder()
  .setWalls(4)
  .setDoors(2)
  .setGarage(true)
  .build();
```

---

## 6️⃣ Builder with Director (Classic GoF Style)

### When do we need Director?

* When **construction steps are fixed**
* But **representation varies**

### Director

```js
class HouseDirector {
  constructor(builder) {
    this.builder = builder;
  }

  buildLuxuryHouse() {
    return this.builder
      .setWalls(4)
      .setDoors(4)
      .setWindows(10)
      .setGarage(true)
      .setPool(true)
      .build();
  }

  buildSimpleHouse() {
    return this.builder
      .setWalls(4)
      .setDoors(1)
      .setWindows(4)
      .build();
  }
}
```

### Usage

```js
const builder = new HouseBuilder();
const director = new HouseDirector(builder);

const luxuryHouse = director.buildLuxuryHouse();
```

---

## 7️⃣ Real-World Analogy

### 🍔 Burger Builder

```js
new BurgerBuilder()
  .addBun("wheat")
  .addPatty("veg")
  .addCheese()
  .addSauce("mayo")
  .build();
```

This is **exactly how Builder Pattern works**.

---

## 8️⃣ Immutability-Friendly Builder

Common in **Java, Kotlin, system-level code**:

```js
class User {
  constructor({ name, age, email }) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.email = email;
    Object.freeze(this);
  }
}

class UserBuilder {
  setName(name) {
    this.name = name;
    return this;
  }

  setAge(age) {
    this.age = age;
    return this;
  }

  setEmail(email) {
    this.email = email;
    return this;
  }

  build() {
    return new User(this);
  }
}
```

---

## 9️⃣ Builder vs Factory (Very Important)

| Aspect                   | Builder          | Factory                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Object creation          | Step-by-step     | One-shot                   |
| Handles complexity       | ✔ Very good      | ❌ Limited                  |
| Optional params          | ✔ Excellent      | ❌ Hard                     |
| Multiple representations | ✔ Yes            | ✔ Yes                      |
| Focus                    | **How to build** | **Which object to create** |

👉 **Factory = selection logic**
👉 **Builder = construction logic**

---

## 🔟 When Should You Use Builder Pattern?

### ✅ Use Builder When:

* Object has **many optional fields**
* Construction is **complex**
* Need **readable & maintainable creation**
* Want **immutability**
* Same construction process → different objects

### ❌ Avoid When:

* Object is simple
* Few parameters
* No construction complexity

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Common Interview Traps ⚠️

❌ Confusing Builder with Factory
❌ Overusing Builder for simple objects
❌ Forgetting `.build()` validation

### Validation Example

```js
build() {
  if (!this.walls || !this.doors) {
    throw new Error("Walls and doors are mandatory");
  }
  return new House(this);
}
```

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Builder Pattern Variants

1. **Fluent Builder** (most common in JS)
2. **Classic GoF Builder (with Director)**
3. **Step Builder** (forces build order)
4. **Immutable Builder**
5. **Nested Builder** (for very complex objects)

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Step Builder (Advanced)

Enforces order at compile/design level (mostly Java/TS)

```js
builder
  .setWalls(4)
  .setDoors(2)
  .setWindows(6)
  .build();
```

Prevents skipping required steps.

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Real Industry Usage

* **React** → JSX is a builder
* **Axios** → request config builder
* **AWS SDK** → request builders
* **Java Lombok @Builder**
* **UI Form builders**

---

## 1️⃣5️⃣ One-Line Summary (Interview Gold)

> “Builder Pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step, separating construction logic from representation, especially when there are many optional parameters.”

---

If you want next:

* **Builder vs Abstract Factory**
* **Builder Pattern in TypeScript (strict types)**
* **Builder Pattern interview questions**
* **Builder in Frontend system design (API request builder)**

Just tell me 👍


Question - in build method, we have "return new Home(this);" even if we just used "return this". we got same object. then why we should go for "return new Home(this);"

Excellent question — this is a **very important Builder-pattern nuance**, and interviewers *love* this one.

Short answer:
👉 **`return this` returns the *builder*, not the *product*.**
👉 **`return new Home(this)` returns the *final object* and freezes the construction phase.**

Let’s go step by step, deeply but clearly.

---

## 1️⃣ What does `this` actually mean inside `build()`?

```js
class HomeBuilder {
  setRooms(r) {
    this.rooms = r;
    return this;
  }

  build() {
    return this;   // ❌
  }
}
```

Here:

* `this` → **HomeBuilder instance**
* NOT a Home
* You are returning the **builder**, not the **product**

So this is what you get:

```js
const home = new HomeBuilder().setRooms(3).build();
```

`home` is still a **HomeBuilder**, not a **Home**.

---

## 2️⃣ Why is that a problem?

### ❌ Builder ≠ Product

| Builder            | Product (Home)     |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Temporary          | Final              |
| Mutable            | Often immutable    |
| Has setter methods | Has domain methods |
| Construction logic | Business logic     |

Returning `this` **leaks construction details**.

---

## 3️⃣ Correct Approach: Create a Separate Product

```js
class Home {
  constructor(builder) {
    this.rooms = builder.rooms;
    this.garage = builder.garage;
    Object.freeze(this); // optional but common
  }
}
```

```js
class HomeBuilder {
  build() {
    return new Home(this); // ✅
  }
}
```

Now:

```js
const home = new HomeBuilder()
  .setRooms(3)
  .setGarage(true)
  .build();
```

✔ `home` is a **Home**
✔ Builder is discarded
✔ Construction phase ends

---

## 4️⃣ Key Concept: **Separation of Concerns**

### With `return this` ❌

* Builder is used as Product
* Construction + Representation mixed
* Violates **Single Responsibility Principle**

### With `return new Home(this)` ✅

* Builder → builds
* Home → represents
* Clean design

---

## 5️⃣ Immutability (Very Important Reason)

### If you return `this`

```js
const home = builder.build();
builder.setRooms(10);

console.log(home.rooms); // 😱 changes!
```

Because `home === builder`

---

### If you return a new object

```js
const home = builder.build();
builder.setRooms(10);

console.log(home.rooms); // ✅ unchanged
```

✔ Product is **stable**
✔ Builder can be reused or discarded

---

## 6️⃣ Validation Happens at `build()`

Builder is the **gatekeeper**.

```js
build() {
  if (!this.rooms) {
    throw new Error("Rooms required");
  }
  return new Home(this);
}
```

If you return `this`, you **can’t enforce validation** cleanly.

---

## 7️⃣ Reuse Builder for Multiple Products

```js
const builder = new HomeBuilder().setRooms(3);

const home1 = builder.build();
const home2 = builder.setGarage(true).build();
```

Works **only** if build creates a **new product each time**.

---

## 8️⃣ When *is* `return this` acceptable?

Only in **non-Builder APIs** like config objects:

```js
axios
  .setHeader(...)
  .setTimeout(...)
  .send();
```

But that’s **not a GoF Builder Pattern** — it’s a **fluent configuration object**.

> We return `new Home(this)` instead of `this` because the Builder is a temporary, mutable construction object, while `Home` is the final, immutable product. Returning the builder leaks construction details, breaks immutability, and violates separation of concerns.

---

## 🔟 Visual Summary

```
Builder (mutable)
   |
   | build()
   v
Product (immutable)
```

If you want, next I can explain:

* **Step Builder vs Normal Builder**
* **Why Lombok @Builder still creates a new object**
* **Builder vs Fluent Interface (important confusion)**

Just say 👍

5) Adapter Pattern 

Let’s go **deep and practical** on the **Adapter Pattern**, with **why, when, structure, variants, pitfalls, and real-world + JS examples**. Since you’re learning design patterns seriously, I’ll treat this like **architect-level understanding**, not just definition.

---

# Adapter Pattern (In Depth)

## 1. What problem does Adapter solve?

> **Adapter allows incompatible interfaces to work together without changing their existing code.**

You already have:

* **Existing / legacy code** (stable, tested, cannot change)
* **New code** that expects a **different interface**

👉 Adapter sits **in between** and **translates** one interface into another.

---

## 2. Real-world analogy (very important)

### Mobile charger adapter 🔌

* Wall socket → **220V Indian socket**
* Charger → **expects a specific plug**

You **don’t change the socket**
You **don’t change the charger**

👉 You add an **adapter**

This is exactly what the Adapter Pattern does in software.

---

## 3. When should you use Adapter?

Use Adapter when:

✅ You want to reuse an **existing class**
✅ But its interface **does not match** what your system expects
✅ You **cannot or should not modify** the existing class
✅ You want to follow **Open–Closed Principle**

🚫 Do NOT use Adapter if:

* You can directly modify the class
* Interfaces already match
* You’re just mapping DTOs (that’s not Adapter)

---

## 4. Structure (Participants)

```
Client  --->  Target (interface)
                  ↑
              Adapter
                  ↓
              Adaptee
```

### Roles:

| Role        | Meaning                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Client**  | Code that needs a specific interface       |
| **Target**  | Interface expected by the client           |
| **Adaptee** | Existing class with incompatible interface |
| **Adapter** | Converts Adaptee to Target                 |

---

## 5. Simple Example (Conceptual)

### Target (what client expects)

```js
class PaymentProcessor {
  pay(amount) {
    throw new Error("Not implemented");
  }
}
```

### Adaptee (existing / legacy class)

```js
class OldPaymentGateway {
  makePayment(valueInRupees) {
    console.log(`Paid ₹${valueInRupees}`);
  }
}
```

### Adapter

```js
class PaymentAdapter extends PaymentProcessor {
  constructor(oldGateway) {
    super();
    this.oldGateway = oldGateway;
  }

  pay(amount) {
    this.oldGateway.makePayment(amount);
  }
}
```

### Client

```js
const oldGateway = new OldPaymentGateway();
const payment = new PaymentAdapter(oldGateway);

payment.pay(500);
```

✔ Client never knows about `OldPaymentGateway`

---

## 6. Adapter vs Direct Wrapping (important distinction)

❌ This is NOT Adapter:

```js
oldGateway.makePayment(500);
```

✔ This IS Adapter:

```js
payment.pay(500);
```

Why?

* Adapter **implements Target interface**
* Client depends on **abstraction**, not concrete class

---

## 7. Two Types of Adapter Pattern

### 1️⃣ Object Adapter (Most Common ✅)

Uses **composition**

```js
class Adapter {
  constructor(adaptee) {
    this.adaptee = adaptee;
  }
}
```

✔ Flexible
✔ Works in JS, Java, TS
✔ Preferred approach

---

### 2️⃣ Class Adapter (Inheritance-based)

Uses **inheritance** (possible in Java, C++, not ideal in JS)

```java
class Adapter extends Adaptee implements Target
```

🚫 Less flexible
🚫 Tightly coupled
🚫 Rarely used in modern systems

---

## 8. Real-World System Example (API Integration)

### Scenario

Your system expects:

```js
getUser(id)
```

Third-party API gives:

```js
fetchUserByUUID(uuid)
```

---

### Target

```js
class UserService {
  getUser(id) {}
}
```

### Adaptee

```js
class ExternalUserAPI {
  fetchUserByUUID(uuid) {
    return { uuid, name: "Sumeet" };
  }
}
```

### Adapter

```js
class UserAdapter extends UserService {
  constructor(api) {
    super();
    this.api = api;
  }

  getUser(id) {
    return this.api.fetchUserByUUID(id);
  }
}
```

### Client

```js
const service = new UserAdapter(new ExternalUserAPI());
service.getUser("123");
```

## 9. Adapter vs Related Patterns (VERY IMPORTANT)

| Pattern       | Difference                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Adapter**   | Makes incompatible interfaces work        |
| **Facade**    | Simplifies a complex system               |
| **Decorator** | Adds behavior without changing interface  |
| **Proxy**     | Controls access                           |
| **Bridge**    | Separates abstraction from implementation |

👉 **Adapter = interface translation**

---

## 10. Adapter + SOLID Principles

✔ **Single Responsibility**

* Adapter only translates interface

✔ **Open–Closed**

* No modification of existing classes

✔ **Dependency Inversion**

* Client depends on Target interface

---

## 11. Common Mistakes

❌ Treating simple helper functions as Adapter
❌ Putting business logic inside Adapter
❌ Adapter calling multiple unrelated classes
❌ Overusing Adapter for internal code

---

## 12. When Adapter becomes a code smell 🚨

* Too many adapters → bad initial design
* Adapter doing transformations + validation + logic
* Adapters chained deeply

👉 That’s when **Facade or refactoring** is better.

---

## 13. Adapter in Frontend / Node.js (Practical)

### Example: Logger Adapter

Different log libraries:

```js
winston.log()
pino.info()
```

You want:

```js
logger.log("message")
```

👉 Create adapters for each logger.

---

## 14. One-line Summary (Interview Gold)

> **Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects, allowing incompatible classes to work together without modifying their source code.**
