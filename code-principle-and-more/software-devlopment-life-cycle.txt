Software Developement Life Cycle ( SDLC ) -
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC / Software Development Process ) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.
	different stages of sdlc -
	a) Planning and Requirement Analysis
	b) Defining Requirements
	c) Designing the Product Architecture
	d) Building or Developing the Product
	e) Testing the Product
	f) Deployment in the Market and Maintenance


SDLC Models =
1) Agile Methodologies -
	* In Agile, instead of Delivering Complete solution, we can split into several services or features and release it in interval.
	* The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating. Continuous collaboration is vital, both with team members and project stakeholders.
	* Scrum, kanban, are frameworks of agile.
	* Agile methodologies is adaptive in nature. In it, we take updates constantly from Client.
	*

	SCRUM Framework - 
	* Unlike waterfall, in Scrum, we create small feature and doing it within short span of time. 
	* we decide sprint ( small period of 1 to 3 weeks ) in which we decide and create modules.
	* 1 sprint contain requirement gathering, design, coding, testing, deploy and review again.
	* Scrum has multiple candidates like Product owner, team (BA, QA, developers, scrum master), stakeholder (client).
	* Daily meeting about daily task ( contain daily updates of task, completion status ) and improvment of previous sprint.
	* SCRUM contain waterfall model in small iterative manner.
