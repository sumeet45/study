  class - 
    . blueprint of object, which have methods and fields
    . we can create mulitple object from one class

  Object - Object can have methods and fields. And its created from class

  Encapsulation - 
    . binding data and function into single unit together, is known as encapsulation
    . it provide data hiding.
    . we can hide details of class from outside world
    . eg. of Encapsulation - Mobile encapsulate circuit, component, camera, and so on,

  Abstraction -
    . Showing essential information and hiding its detail implementation
    . eg. clicking picture, but we don't know how its implemented

  Polymorphism -
    . same function behave differently in different situation
    . mobile restart button, helps to switch off and switch on based on current mobile condition

  Inheritance - 
    . inherit props and methods of base class. (  )
    . derived class can have their own feature also. ( in android, we have ble. but for ios, we don't have ble )
    .
