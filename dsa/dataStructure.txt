* abstract data type
  * ADT is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which data structure must adhere to.
  * ADT only defines how a DS should behave, and methods should have. but not details implementation.

* complexity analysis -
  * time and space -  how much required?

* big o tells about worst case

* Big O notation - (7:27)
  from small to large order -
  0(1)  -constant time
  0(log (n)) - logarithmic time
  0(n) - Linear time
  0(nlog(n)) - 
  0(n^2)
  0(n^3)
  0(b^n), b > 1
  0(n!)

  * we remove constant values from big o notation


  * Static and Dynamic arrays -
    * Static Array = 
      * static arrays is fixed length container containing n elements indexable from the range [0, n-1]
      * static arrays are given as contiguous (next to each other) chunks of memory. 
      * what is indexable? - each slot/ index in the array can be referenced with a number.
      * when and where is static array used? -
            1) Storing and accessing sequential data, 
            2) temporarily storing objects
            3) used by IO routines as buffers
            4) lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
            and many more places.
    * table
            static arr       dynamic arr
access        0(1)            0(1)
search        0(n)            0(n)
Insertion     N/A             0(n)
Appending     N/A             0(1)
Deletion      N/A             0(n)

    * array start indexing with 0.
    * 

  * Operations on Dynamic Arrays -
    * to create dynamic array using static array - create static array with 2 elements place and add all 2 numbers in it. once u want to add 3rd element, just create one more array with 3 space for elements and copy all elements from older array and add new numbers in the end.
