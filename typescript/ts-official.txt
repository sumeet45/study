Typescript Official Site -

* The Basics -
  * It shows why we need to use typing with Javascript.
  * TypeScript can catch bugs when we make mistakes in our code. That’s great, but TypeScript can also prevent us from making those mistakes in the first place.
  * Need to understand...

* Everyday Types -
  * Types can also appear in many more places than just type annotations. As we learn about the types themselves, we’ll also learn about the places where we can refer to these types to form new constructs.

  * The primitives: string, number, and boolean
  
  * Array - To specify the type of an array like [1, 2, 3], you can use the syntax - number[] or Array<number>
  
  * any - TypeScript also has a special type, any, that you can use whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.
  
  * noImplicitAny - 
     * When you don’t specify a type, and TypeScript can’t infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to any.
     * You usually want to avoid this, though, because any isn’t type-checked. Use the compiler flag noImplicitAny to flag any implicit any as an error.
  
  * Type Annotations on Variables -
      let myName: string = "Alice";     // you can optionally add a type annotation to explicitly specify the type of the variable
      * TypeScript doesn’t use “types on the left”-style declarations like int x = 0; Type annotations will always go after the thing being typed.
  
  * Functions -  Functions are the primary means of passing data around in JavaScript. TypeScript allows you to specify the types of both the input and output values of functions.


  * Parameter Type Annotations - When you declare a function, you can add type annotations after each parameter to declare what types of parameters the function accepts. Parameter type annotations go after the parameter name: 
      // Parameter type annotation
      function greet(name: string) {
        console.log("Hello, " + name.toUpperCase() + "!!");
      }


  * Return Type Annotations - You can also add return type annotations. Return type annotations appear after the parameter list:
      function getFavoriteNumber(): number {
         return 26;
       }


  * Functions Which Return Promises - If you want to annotate the return type of a function which returns a promise, you should use the Promise type:
      async function getFavoriteNumber(): Promise<number> {
        return 26;
      }


  * Anonymous Functions - 
        *  Anonymous functions are a little bit different from function declarations. When a function appears in a place where TypeScript can determine how it’s going to be called, the parameters of that function are automatically given types.
         const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"];
          
         // Contextual typing for function - parameter s inferred to have type string
         names.forEach(function (s) {
           console.log(s.toUpperCase());
         });
          
         // Contextual typing also applies to arrow functions
         names.forEach((s) => {
           console.log(s.toUpperCase());
         });

       * Even though the parameter s didn’t have a type annotation, TypeScript used the types of the forEach function, along with the inferred type of the array, to determine the type s will have. This process is called contextual typing because the context that the function occurred within informs what type it should have.


  * Object Types -
        // The parameter's type annotation is an object type
        function printCoord(pt: { x: number; y: number }) {          // can use , or ;
          console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
          console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
        }
        printCoord({ x: 3, y: 7 });


  * Optional Properties -
     function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {      // To do this, add a ? after the property name
        // ...
     }
     * In JavaScript, if you access a property that doesn’t exist, you’ll get the value undefined rather than a runtime error. Because of this, when you read from an optional property, you’ll have to check for undefined before using it.

 * Unions - 
     * TypeScript’s type system allows you to build new types out of existing ones using a large variety of operators. 
     * Defining a Union Type - The first way to combine types you might see is a union type. A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values that may be any one of those types. We refer to each of these types as the union’s members.
      function printId(id: number | string) {
         console.log("Your ID is: " + id);
       }
     * Working with Union Types -
       



   * you usually don’t need type annotation because TypeScript will infer type at its own
