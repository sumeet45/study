* Database - It is a simple container to store data. If we use files instead of DB, it will be quite messy and a long process. 
* SQL is a language to talk with a database. stands for Structured Query Language.

1) DBMS & SQL Server -
* We have data inside the database. With different SQL, every user accesses the database.
* DBMS is software which manages requests to the database for every user, and also handles security.
* SERVER - server means a system which should be online 24/7. It hosts our database and DBMS software.

In short -
Database - stores data
SQL - speaks to the database
DBMS - manages the database
server - where the database lives

2) DB types - 
* relational DB - in it, we have tables, which contain rows and columns. They have a relationship with other tables also. Hence we call this relational DB
* key-value  db - key-value db is also called a no-relational db.
* column based db - in it, data is grouped according to the column. It is quite advanced and handles big data. The main purpose of this DB is to search for data.
* graph based DB - 
* Document-Based DB -

* From above, key-value, column based, graph, document-based DBs, are called "No-SQL database".
* Microsoft SQL server, MySQL, PostgreSQL are types of SQL relational Database.
* key-value DB example - Redis, Amazon Dynamo DB
* column-based DB example - Apache Casandra, Amazon Redshift
* Graph DB example - Neo4J
* Document-Based DB example - MongoDB


3) Database Structure -
hierarchy =>
* Server - Who holds databases and will be available online all time.
* Database - In Server, we can have multiple databases.
* Schema - In each Database, we can have multiple schema. It is like category, which helps to group up related objects.
* Table - Each Schema contain multiple objects like tables. In table, we have column and row. We call "field" for column. For each row, we call it as "record". We also have "Primary key" in table. It helps to find unique record.
* Cell - single cell store value which have specific data types. Data types -> Numeric (INT, DECIMAL), Text (CHAR, VARCHAR), Date & Time (DATE, TIME)


4) SQL Commands -
* DDL commands - helps to create table, alter table or drop table.
* DML commands - helps to insert a new data, update and delete data.
* DATA Query Language - Using 'Select', we can retrieve data.

5) Why learn SQL?
* To talk with data, High Demand Job, Industry Standards

6) Setup your Enviornment ( Install SQL server ) -
* using docker with sqlserver-express ( for storing database ) and "SQL server(mssql)" extension of VS code ( for GUI ).
