The Basics =

1) Core Components and Native Components =
* React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native capabilities.
* using JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components

a) Views and mobile development
* a view is the basic building block of UI
* used to display text, images, or respond to user input

b) Native Components
* With React Native, you can invoke platform specific views with JavaScript using React components.
* At runtime, React Native creates the corresponding Android and iOS views for those components.
* We call these platform-backed components "Native Components".
* React Native comes with a set of essential, ready-to-use Native Components you can use to start building your app today. These are React Native's Core Components.

c) Core Components
* React Native has many Core Components for everything from form controls to activity indicators.
* React Native uses the same API structure as React components
* React Native Components contain-
	React components, React Native Components (Community Components, Core Components, Own Native Component)



2) React Fundamentals =
* React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript.
* First Component =
	
	import React from "react";
	import { Text } from "react-native";

	const cat = () => {
		return <Text>Cat</Text>
	}
	export default cat;

* JSX = 
	* React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript.

* Custom Components =

* Developer notes =
	* On Android, you usually put your views inside LinearLayout, FrameLayout, RelativeLayout, etc. to define how the view’s children will be arranged on the screen.
	* Any component that renders other components is a parent component. And those other components are child components.

* Props =
	* Props is short for “properties”.
	* Image has many different props, including style, which accepts a JS object of design and layout related property-value pairs.

* State =
	* While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a component’s personal data storage.
